Encrypto lets you encrypt files before sending them to friends or coworkers. Drop a file into Encrypto, set a password, and then send it with added security.

## Notes
- **This is an unofficial package not submitted to the Chocolatey repo.** This was made for my personal use, but you are free to create a nupkg for yourself using my source.
- I am in no way affiliated with Encrypto or the creator, MacPaw. I cannot troubleshoot issues related to Encrypto itself.
- This Chocolately package is not guaranteed to work, though I do test before committing changes. If it does not work, feel free to raise an issue.
