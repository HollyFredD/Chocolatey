## What is this?
This repo contains Chocolatey packages created by me. Learn more about Chocolatey at https://chocolatey.org.

## Did you make these apps?
I have no affiliation with any application in this repo unless otherwise stated in an individual README file. All I do is package them in the Chocolatey-preferred format. I provide zero support for the applications, but I may provide assistance with the Chocolatey package themselves if there's any issues arising from them.
